My first repository in Holberton School

This  repository is about:

1. How to create a new repository in Github
2. How to create the local directory
3. How to create a README.md file
4. And finally how to push those files to the remote server (Github)

Also this repository contains the principales (seven) commands to use Emacs. Yo can find tnem in directory 0x01-emacs

Finally in directory 0x00-vagrant you can find what does the command uname do when yo write it in Ubuntu
